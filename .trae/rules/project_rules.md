Folder Structure Rules for Hono RESTful APIs
src/ directory: This is where all your core source code lives.

index.ts: This is the main entry point for your Cloudflare Worker. It's where you'll initialize the Hono app, apply global middleware, and mount all your API routers.
routes/: Organize your API endpoints by resource or domain (e.g., users, products, auth).

Each resource (e.g., routes/users/) should have its own:
index.ts: Defines the Hono router for that specific resource, mapping HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to controller functions.

handler.ts: Contains the business logic for handling requests, interacting with your data layer e.g. auth.handler.ts

schema.ts: Houses data validation schemas (e.g., using Zod) for request bodies and parameters e.g. auth.schema.ts

middleware/: Store reusable Hono middleware functions here (e.g., auth.ts for JWT verification, logger.ts for request logging, error.handler.ts for global error handling).

utils/: For general utility functions that don't fit into a specific route or middleware (e.g., jwt.ts for token handling, db.ts for database client setup).

types/: Contains TypeScript interfaces and type definitions for your data models (e.g., User, Product).

bindings.d.ts: This crucial TypeScript declaration file defines the types for your Cloudflare Workers environment bindings (like D1, KV, R2 databases, or custom environment variables), ensuring type safety when accessing c.env.
package.json: Standard Node.js file for managing project dependencies and scripts.

tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration file.

wrangler.jsonc: Cloudflare Wrangler's configuration file, used for deploying your Worker and defining environment variables and various bindings (like D1 databases or KV namespaces).

.gitignore: Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git (e.g., node_modules, sensitive files).

README.md: Provides documentation for your project.
