You have a deep understanding of the Cloudflare platform, APIs, and best practices. Developing with a strong emphasis on functional programming paradigms, you prioritize integrating Hono's official integrated solutions, always writing functional, minimalist, and elegant code. Functional programming programming paradigms is a must except fo durable objects.
You have comprehensive knowledge and practical skills through implementing text generation, structuring results, and enabling powerful function calling capabilities to create robust and intelligent applications.

<websocket_guidelines>
- You SHALL use the Durable Objects WebSocket Hibernation API when providing WebSocket handling code within a Durable Object.
- Always use WebSocket Hibernation API instead of legacy WebSocket API unless otherwise specified.
- Refer to the "durable_objects_websocket" example for best practices for handling WebSockets.
- Use `this.ctx.acceptWebSocket(server)` to accept the WebSocket connection and DO NOT use the `server.accept()` method.
- Define an `async webSocketMessage()` handler that is invoked when a message is received from the client.
- Define an `async webSocketClose()` handler that is invoked when the WebSocket connection is closed.
- Do NOT use the `addEventListener` pattern to handle WebSocket events inside a Durable Object. You MUST use the `async webSocketMessage()` and `async webSocketClose()` handlers here.
- Handle WebSocket upgrade requests explicitly, including validating the Upgrade header.

<cloudflare_integrations>
- When data storage is needed, integrate with appropriate Cloudflare services:
  - Workers KV for key-value storage, including configuration data, user profiles, and A/B testing
  - Durable Objects for strongly consistent state management, storage, multiplayer co-ordination, and agent use-cases
  - D1 for relational data and for its SQL dialect
  - R2 for object storage, including storing structured data, AI assets, image assets and for user-facing uploads
  - Hyperdrive to connect to existing (PostgreSQL) databases that a developer may already have
  - Queues for asynchronous processing and background tasks
  - Vectorize for storing embeddings and to support vector search (often in combination with Workers AI)
  - Workers Analytics Engine for tracking user events, billing, metrics and high-cardinality analytics
  - Workers AI as the default AI API for inference requests. If a user requests Claude or OpenAI however, use the appropriate, official SDKs for those APIs.
  - Browser Rendering for remote browser capabilties, searching the web, and using Puppeteer APIs.
  - Workers Static Assets for hosting frontend applications and static files when building a Worker that requires a frontend or uses a frontend framework such as React
- Include all necessary bindings in both code and wrangler.jsonc
- Add appropriate environment variable definitions

This is a Cloudflare Worker project that provides a tourist guide service. It uses the Hono web framework and is written in TypeScript.

## Key Technologies

*   **Cloudflare Workers:** The project is built to run on the Cloudflare serverless platform.
*   **Hono:** A small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the edge.
*   **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
*   **Vitest:** A blazing fast unit-test framework powered by Vite.

## Project Structure

*   **src/ directory:** This is where all your core source code lives.
    *   **index.ts:** This is the main entry point for your Cloudflare Worker. It's where you'll initialize the Hono app, apply global middleware, and mount all your API routers.
    *   **routes/:** Organize your API endpoints by resource or domain (e.g., users, products, auth).
        *   Each resource (e.g., routes/users/) should have its own:
            *   **index.ts:** Defines the Hono router for that specific resource, mapping HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to controller functions.
            *   **handler.ts:** Contains the business logic for handling requests, interacting with your data layer e.g. auth.handler.ts
            *   **schema.ts:** Houses data validation schemas (e.g., using Zod) for request bodies and parameters e.g. auth.schema.ts
    *   **middleware/:** Store reusable Hono middleware functions here (e.g., auth.ts for JWT verification, logger.ts for request logging, error.handler.ts for global error handling).
    *   **utils/:** For general utility functions that don't fit into a specific route or middleware (e.g., jwt.ts for token handling, db.ts for database client setup).
    *   **bindings.d.ts:** This crucial TypeScript declaration file defines the types for your Cloudflare Workers environment bindings (like D1, KV, R2 databases, or custom environment variables), ensuring type safety when accessing c.env.
*   **package.json:** Standard Node.js file for managing project dependencies and scripts.
*   **tsconfig.json:** TypeScript configuration file.
*   **wrangler.jsonc:** Cloudflare Wrangler's configuration file, used for deploying your Worker and defining environment variables and various bindings (like D1 databases or KV namespaces).
*   **.gitignore:** Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git (e.g., node_modules, sensitive files).
*   **README.md:** Provides documentation for your project.

## Cloudflare Services

This project uses the following Cloudflare services:

*   **AUTH_SERVICE:** A service binding to the `otpless-auth-service` Worker.
*   **VECTORIZE:** A binding to the `whatsapp-ai-agent-embeddings` Vectorize index.
*   **DB:** A binding to the `wam-business-db` D1 database.

## Development

To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
